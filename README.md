## What is Pitchi?
Pitchi is a program aimed at making learning and understanding Japanese and its pitch accent patterns easier. By searching Pitchi lists, you can visually see the pitch accent pattern of a word along with its romaji, definition, and any comments on its usage.

## Where does Pitchi get its information?
Pitchi relys on the user to supply it with Pitchi lists in the form of configuration files saved as in the ".lst" format. These lists can be created by the user if they want to make their own personal lists or the lists can be shared between community members. These lists can be kept seperate or imported into one list, prefferably a "master" list.

## How to Install
Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/ChoerrySoul/Pitchi/releases) page and move it into the desired installation folder. Pitchi will create a data directory inside that folder which will contain all required assets, the local list, and the local theme directories.
